# PopupUnderline
Uses popups to set if the user wants an underline and also where.

I have the Yes button able to pull up a popup which allows the user to input which line they want to put a underline in.

The No button works and gives a comeback for it when clicked.

My current problems (in order that needs to be done):

1. I need to get the table that I made into the webpage.
2. i have it ready to go in, but I cant seem to find out how to do it.
3. My code for inserting a line should work but I dont know how to test it without it being inside of the webpage (or outside for that matter)
4. Fucking tired of doing this. I have over 20 tabs open, all with different ways to doing this, and none have worked/ im not skilled enough to make them work.
5. All my code is the same except for a few exports(one of my tries) and the index.html is completely different.
