How to run: (node app.js) in terminal
            go to webpage localhost:8001
            click either yes or no and follow onscreen instructions


# PopupUnderline
Uses popups to set if the user wants an underline and also where.

Click the Yes button to pull up a popup which allows the user to input which line they want to put a underline in.

My current problems (in order that needs to be done):

DONE 1. I need to get the table that I made into the webpage. 
DONE 2. i have it ready to go in, but I cant seem to find out how to do it.
3. My code for inserting a line doesnt work due to the fact I dont know how to call the table (blaming others for myy problems)
